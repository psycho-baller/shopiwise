## Getting Started with Development

This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To make a production build, run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework.
